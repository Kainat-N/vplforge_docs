# Understand User Interface

Now that youâ€™ve launched the VPLForge framework, you'll see a clean and organized user interface designed for visual programming.

Here's a breakdown of the key UI elements:  
- **Canvas**  
  The large grid area in the center is the canvas where you can drag, drop, and connect components to build your programs.  
- **Toolbar**  
  The vertical toolbar on the left side provides quick access to different features such as:  
  - New Program
  - Open Program
  - Save Program
  - Go to centre (takes you back to the centre of canvas)
  - Zoom In
  - Zoom Out
  - Delete Object
  - Connect Objects
  - Disconnect Objects
  - Load Language
  - Download Component
  - Clear Console
  - Compile and Download Code
  - Compile and Execute Code
You can select any of these icons to control the view, interact with components, and run programs.
- **Component Library**  
  This panel displays the **components or blocks** of the currently loaded visual programming language. You can drag these onto the canvas to start building your programs.

- **Properties Panel**  
  Once a block or component is selected, its **properties** appear here that lets you enter the values/code for that block or component. Initially, it will show `No Language Loaded`, indicating that no visual language definition (JSON) is active yet.  
- **Console**  
  The console at the bottom shows the output from the program execution. It helps in debugging and understanding program behavior.
