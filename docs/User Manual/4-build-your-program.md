# Build Your Program

### Step 1: Write Code
Drag and Drop components from the **Components Library** onto the **Canvas**.  

Each program must start with the `Start Program` block and end with the `End Program` block.  

To configure operations such as assigning values to variables or adding conditions to if-statements/loops, use the **Properties Panel** located at the bottom-right of the screen.

### Step 2: Execute Code
After writing your code, you can compile and execute it using the `Compile and Execute Code` button at the very bottom of the toolbar. 

This will display the output of your program on the **Console**.
