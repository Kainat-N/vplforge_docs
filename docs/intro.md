# What is VPLForge?

**VPLForge** is a framework designed to facilitate the creation of visual programming languages (VPLs). It aims to streamline the development of VPLs by offering reusable components and design tools.

---
## 1. Overview of the Framework

VPLForge enables rapid development of visual programming environments by providing:

- A modular architecture for building custom VPLs
- Integration with domain-specific tools
- Support for code generation and simulation

### Technologies Used

- React.js for the visual interface
- TypeScript for type-safe development
- WebAssembly for performance-critical components
- Graph-based layout engine

---

## 1.2 Rationale Behind VPLForge

### The Problem VPLForge Aims to Solve

Most existing VPLs are built from scratch, requiring significant effort and expertise. VPLForge reduces this burden by offering reusable and extensible components.

### Why It's Needed in the Current VPL Ecosystem

- Lack of standardization
- Poor scalability in educational tools
- Difficulty adapting VPLs for new domains (e.g., robotics, IoT)

---

## 1.3 Target Audience

- **VPL Designers**: Developers, researchers, and educators designing new VPLs.
- **VPL Users**: Students, hobbyists, and domain experts using low-code tools.

---

## 1.4 Use Cases

- üéì **Educational Tools**: Create intuitive block-based environments for teaching coding.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Rapid Prototyping**: Build quick workflows for IoT and robotics projects.
- üß† **Domain-Specific Automation**: Tailor VPLs for business logic, automation, or simulations.

## 1.5 Benefits of VPLForge

VPLForge offers several key advantages to developers and users of visual programming environments:

- **Ease of Defining VPLs**: Provides reusable components to reduce boilerplate and speed up development.
- **Instant Execution and Testing**: Integrated testing tools allow for quick iteration and feedback.
- **Cross-Platform and Offline Availability**: Built as a web-based platform that works on all major operating systems‚Äîeven offline.

## 1.6 About Visual Programming Languages (VPLs)

Visual Programming Languages (VPLs) allow users to create programs by manipulating graphical elements rather than writing code in text-based formats.

### Common Types of VPLs

- **Block-Based Programming**: Users create logic using draggable blocks (e.g., Scratch, Blockly).
- **Flowchart-Based Programming**: Visualizes control flow using process diagrams (e.g., RAPTOR).
- **Dataflow-Based Programming**: Connects data between operations using wires or links (e.g., LabVIEW).

VPLForge supports the creation of all these types of VPLs and can be extended to hybrid systems.
