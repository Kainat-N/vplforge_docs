# What is VPLForge?

**VPLForge** is a framework designed to facilitate the creation of visual programming languages (VPLs). It aims to streamline the development of VPLs by offering reusable components and design tools.

---
## 1. Overview of the Framework

VPLForge enables rapid development of visual programming environments by providing:

- A modular architecture for building custom VPLs
- Integration with domain-specific tools
- Support for code generation and simulation

### Technologies Used

- React.js for the visual interface
- TypeScript for type-safe development
- WebAssembly for performance-critical components
- Graph-based layout engine

---

## 1.2 Rationale Behind VPLForge

### The Problem VPLForge Aims to Solve

Most existing VPLs are built from scratch, requiring significant effort and expertise. VPLForge reduces this burden by offering reusable and extensible components.

### Why It's Needed in the Current VPL Ecosystem

- Lack of standardization
- Poor scalability in educational tools
- Difficulty adapting VPLs for new domains (e.g., robotics, IoT)

---

## 1.3 Target Audience

- **VPL Designers**: Developers, researchers, and educators designing new VPLs.
- **VPL Users**: Students, hobbyists, and domain experts using low-code tools.

---

## 1.4 Use Cases

- üéì **Educational Tools**: Create intuitive block-based environments for teaching coding.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Rapid Prototyping**: Build quick workflows for IoT and robotics projects.
- üß† **Domain-Specific Automation**: Tailor VPLs for business logic, automation, or simulations.

## Try a Demo

Get started by **trying a demo** at [vplforge demo](https://vplforge.nullprime.com/).

<!-- Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**. -->

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
