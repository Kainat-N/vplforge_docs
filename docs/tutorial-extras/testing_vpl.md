## How to test a VPL before finalizing it

Before finalizing your VPL, it's crucial to test its behavior and ensure that all blocks behave as expected. Follow these steps:

1. Place your JSON file in the `public/samples` folder of the `unified-vpl-framework`.

2. Run the framework locally using the development server:

```bash 
yarn web
```
Once the server starts, you'll see a canvas in the middle and a vertical toolbar panel on the left side. 

3. Click on the **Load Language** icon.

4. Navigate to the **samples** folder where you placed your JSON file.

5. Select your JSON file.
Your language will now be loaded and ready for testing!

6. Test your VPL's components using drag-and-drop functionality

7. Execute your program and validate its working by checking the output shown in the Console window.

8. Optionally, download the code generated by your program.

(Refer to the user guide section for detailed assistance with the VPL framework.)
